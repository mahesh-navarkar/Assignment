Integers are commonly used for counting, indexing, and performing mathematical operations.\n\n2) String (str): Strings are used to represent textual data. They are enclosed in single quotes ('') or double quotes (\"\"). Strings can contain letters,    numbers, symbols, and spaces. For example: \"Hello, World!\", 'Mahesh', \"12345\". Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created.      However, you can manipulate and concatenate strings using various built-in string operations and methods.\n\n3) Boolean (bool): Booleans represent truth values and have two possible values: True and False. They are used for logical operations and conditions.      Booleans are typically the result of comparisons and logical operations. For example: True, False. Booleans are useful for controlling the flow of a    program through conditional statements and loops.\n\n4) Floating-point numbers (float) for decimal values\n\n5) Lists (list) for ordered collections of items",
